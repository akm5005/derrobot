<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
We seek to create a chatbot capable of performing multidimensional translation evaluation with feedback without making any LLM API calls. We hope that this approach is more interpretable and deterministic than existing state-of-the-art.

At the moment we only support the German-English language pair.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


### Installation
1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/aphil311/teach-bs.git`.
2. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   - You must downgrade to `pip < 24.1` with `pip install pip=24.0` to install `laser_encoders`.
   - You can upgrade after installing.


### Usage
1. Run the streamlit app with `streamlit run app.py`.
2. The chatbot will immediately prompt you with a German to English translation.
    - You can switch to English to German on the sidebar.
3. Scores are computed as the raw arithmetic mean and can be found in the 'scores' sidebar tab.
